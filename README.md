## Go Concurrency Patterns

Golang concurrency patterns from Rob Pike Google I/O 2012.

### Concurrency is NOT parallelism

Concurrency is not parallelism, although it enables parallelism.
See [golang.org/s/concurrency-is-not-parallelism](golang.org/s/concurrency-is-not-parallelism)

### Distinction

Go is the latest on the Newsqueak-Alef-Limbo branch, distinguished by first-class channels.
